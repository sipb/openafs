    - fix segfault with aklog -path.
  * The 1.6.10~pre1-1 changelog entry contains a full summary of changes
    in the upstream release.
  * Add a systemd unit file for openafs-client. (Closes: #760063)
    - The variables AFS_PRE_SHUTDOWN and AFS_POST_INIT from
      /etc/openafs.afs.conf are no longer honored.  They should be
      converted to the systemd format and placed in
      /etc/systemd/system/openafs-client.service.d/ ; automatic conversion
      is not possible.  In particular, the kill_all_afs functionality is
      not available.
    - The LIBAFS, MODULEDIR, and DKMSDIR settings from
      /etc/openafs/afs.conf are not used by the unit file.
    - The extra shutdown handling for when the NFS translator is used
      was not converted to the systemd format; the necessary feature
      was removed from the Linux kernel in 2008.
    - Support for cold shutdowns is removed.  They generally resulted
      only in strange failures later on.
  * Add a systemd unit file for openafs-fileserver.
  * Use heap-allocated buffers of sufficient length for realpath() in
    userok.c. (Closes: #757378)
  * Update Dutch translation. (Closes: #765083)

    - Linux kernels up to 3.16 are now supported.
    - The amount of free space and reported for /afs is now 2 TiB, up
      from the previous reported value of around 9 GiB.
    - Fix 'pts removeuser' behavior in the ptserver for some supergroups
      over a certain membership size.
    - Fix logging behavior when rotating logs via the "copy and truncate"
      approach.
    - Add new log messages in the volserver log and the vlserver audit log.
    - Reduce the amount of kernel stack space used in the client.
    - Improve error handling for a wide variety of cases for various tools.
    - Improve periodic hanging in the client when a large number of PAGs
      and files are in use.
    - Fix 'afs-up' to handle large ACLs correctly.
    - Fix a crash in 'aklog' when retrying ticket acquisition.
    - Fix a crash in xstat_fs_test and scout when their local port is
      already in use.
    - Fix an error in the client lock handling that prevented checking
      for the existence of write locks on readonly volumes.
    - Fix an error in the client that could cause cache inconsistencies
      if another client removed a directory entry, and recreated a
      different entry with the same name.
    - Avoid ignoring build failures during the client kernel module build
      process, hopefully leading to better error messages in some cases
      when building the kernel module.
    - Fix various possible problems when building with parallel make.

openafs (1.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Change the default fileserver sync behavior from delayed to
      onclose so that explicit syncing only happens when a volume is
      detached.
    - Add -offline-timeout and -offline-shutdown-timeout options to the
      fileserver, allowing interrupting of clients accessing volumes that
      the fileserver is trying to take off-line.
    - Fix RX bug that could hide errors during packet reception.
    - Fix vos size -dump display for large volumes.
    - Give up callbacks when the client is shut down.  This can cause
      crashes in old fileservers (prior to 1.4.6).
    - Restore vos e alias for vos examine.
    - Throttle byte-range lock warnings per file, and include the FID of
      the file that the client is trying to lock.
    - Avoid a possible panic during shutdown while tracing.
    - Fix a bug that could cause getcwd to fail to find parent
      directories.

openafs (1.6.6~pre2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release.
    - Linux kernels up to 3.12 are now supported, including kernels with
      user namespace support enabled (which affects Debian's 3.12-1 kernel
      and newer).
    - Fixed core dumps into AFS with current kernels.
    - When starting the client fails, backing device information created
      in sysfs is now properly cleared.
    - The AFS mountpoint specified in the cacheinfo file must now be an

      fail and read locks always succeed.
    - New fs flushall command to discard all cached data.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the client to incorrectly believe its
      cache was up to date.
    - New -rxmaxfrags switch to afsd to limit the number of UDP fragments
      sent or received per RX packet.
    - Fixed afsd threads entering an infinite loop.
    - The file server now ignores any vice partitions with a NeverAttach
      flag file present in the root directory.
    - Enabled server-side NAT pings to refresh NAT timeouts.
    - Forcing file server CPS recalculation (for IP ACLs) is now
      restricted to administrators.
    - vos examine of a volume in a transaction is now shown as busy again
      rather than off-line.
    - Multiple bug fixes to the salvager.

openafs (1.6.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix support for tmpfs as the cache filesystem.
    - Support kernels with backported changes affecting getname/putname.
  * Exit successfully in the openafs-client init script if /sbin/afsd
    doesn't exist, indicating that openafs-client is not installed.
  * Load /lib/lsdb/init-functions in the openafs-client init script as the
    first step towards upstart or systemd support.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

openafs (1.6.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Support for Linux 3.11 and 3.12 (up to 3.12-rc3).
    - Fixed core dumps into AFS with some Linux kernels.
  * Cherry-pick additional upstream fixes.
    - [7242e25a] Fix library ordering when building aklog.
    - [514fc63d] Fix budb crash when the -servers command-line option
      is given.  (Closes: #718253)
  * Ignore errors when reading ThisCell in the openafs-client config
    script.  If the file doesn't end in a newline, read will still succeed
    and set the variable, but will exit with a non-zero status.  This
    would abort configuration of the package without a useful error
    message.
  * Drop Recommends of libjs-jquery in openafs-doc.  We're no longer
    replacing the embedded jQuery, pending a better fix in the Doxygen
    packaging.
  * Optimize the get-orig-source target.  Thanks, Anders Kaseorg.
  * Translation updates:
    - German, thanks Erik Pfannenstein.  (Closes: #719154)

openafs (1.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - OPENAFS-SA-2013-003: New support for non-DES enctypes in the
      long-lived AFS key.  This requires deploying rxkad.keytab files on
      each server containing all of the encryption types for the cell AFS
      key.  Once this is deployed on servers, DES will only be used for
      the session key.  Once deployed on all clients, a stronger security
      mechanism will be used that allows the DES keys to be removed from
      the AFS principal in the Kerberos KDC (but still uses DES for some
      session encryption purposes).  (CVE-2013-4134)
    - OPENAFS-SA-2013-004: Properly support the -encrypt option in vos,
      including with -localauth.  (CVE-2013-4135)
  * Move the documentation and kernel module build dependencies to
    Build-Depends-Indep and only do those parts of the build if building
    architecture-independent packages.
  * Drop the sequence numbers from the openafs-client init script
    registration.  Debian now always uses dependency-based boot ordering.
  * Translation updates:
    - Japanese, thanks victory.  (Closes: #714223)

openafs (1.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Support for Linux 3.9 and 3.10.  (Closes: #711920)
    - Multiple fixes for use after free, use of uninitialized memory,
      and similar C memory management bugs found via code analysis.
    - Obey jumbo/nojumbo settings for Ubik (database) servers.
    - General improvements in diagnostic and log messages.
    - Avoid incorrectly sending small amounts of data over the wire
      unencrypted in some situations and report the correct error message
      in this case.
    - Avoid generating duplicate IDs for readonly and backup volumes.
    - Return quota and free space information without an access check.
    - Improve client bookkeeping in the file server, fixing several
      potential corruption and segfault issues.
    - Avoid known cases of silent data corruption in background syncs in
      the file server.
    - Run-time configuration support for fileserver synchronization.
    - Fix transient network error interference with establishing a ubik
      quorum.
    - Do not discard the persistent client disk cache on restart.
    - Fix bugs that made it impossible to unmount a disk cache file system
      after it had been used by the client.
  * Give openafs-dbserver its own documentation directory rather than
    linking it to openafs-client, allowing relaxation of the versioned
    dependency on openafs-client to Recommends.  (However, openafs-client
    will still have to be installed for the openafs-fileserver init
    script, which uses the bos binary, so will still be pulled in by
    dependencies.)
  * Cleanup of the openafs-client postinst script.
    - Perform all work unconditionally to handle various rare error
      recovery cases properly.
    - Only force creation of CellServDB on initial installation or if
      AFSDB/SRV records are not being used.
  * Remove openafs-fileserver postinst support for upgrades from ancient
    versions (1.4.4.dfsg1-4 and 1.4.11+dfsg-3).
  * General coding style cleanup of maintainer scripts.

openafs (1.6.2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Support for Linux 3.8.
  * Support configuring -dynroot-sparse via debconf.  The AFS_DYNROOT
    option in /etc/openafs/afs.conf.client is now tri-valued instead of a
    boolean, and the boolean values will be mapped to the corresponding

openafs (1.6.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - OPENAFS-SA-2013-001: Fix fileserver buffer overflow when parsing
      client-supplied ACL entries and protect against client parsing of
      bad ACL entries.  (CVE-2013-1794)
    - OPENAFS-SA-2013-002: Fix ptserver buffer overflow via integer
      overflow in the IdToName RPC.  (CVE-2013-1795)
    - Fix aklog warning about allow_weak_crypto.
  * Update CellServDB to the 2013-01-28 version.
  * Fix DKMS builds of the OpenAFS kernel module for amd64 kernels on the
    i386 architecture by parsing the kernel version for the architecture
    and kernel class and using that to tell the OpenAFS build system what
    sysname to use.  Patch from Thorsten Alteholz.
  * Avoid re-running setup after build when building modules from the
    openafs-modules-source package with module-assistant.  This will
    hopefully avoid an issue where, following an upgrade of
    openafs-modules-source, module-assistant cannot build new module
    packages without an intervening module-assistant clean.  Patch from
    Thorsten Alteholz.  (Closes: #660622)
  * Make another attempt at suppressing the wildcard action for building
    debian/rules to fix problems building module packages using
    make-kpkg.  Patch from Thorsten Alteholz.  (Closes: #639475)

    - Add additional objects to the *_pic libraries in support of the AFS
      Perl bindings.

    support armhf.  These files aren't used during a package build, so no
    need to carry a Debian patch.

openafs (1.6.2~pre2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream prerelease.
    - Support Linux kernels up to 3.7.  (Closes: #685973)
    - Fix fileservers to properly report >2 TiB partitions.
    - Fix stale volume info from vos examine on non-DAFS filservers.
    - Fix possible volume corruption with vos convertROtoRW.
    - Fix bosserver to preserve all command-line options over restart.
    - Fix bosserver to properly kill hung processes during shutdown.
    - Fixes for memcache, especially on Solaris.
    - Increase the size of the DNS resolver answer buffer to allow sites
      with a long response list to use SRV and AFSDB records.
    - Fix possible abuse of fs mkmount.  In previous versions, users could
      crash a client by nesting volume mounts.
    - Fix client page cache corruption on Linux.  When multiple clients
      read and write to a file, the reading client may see first couple
      bytes of a file as nulls.
    - Support newer glibc versions.
  * Build-Depend on hardening-wrapper and enable it to work around the
    current upstream munging of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.  (Closes: #659663)
  * Fix server installation instructions in README.servers, which used the
    early demand-attach syntax before separate demand-attach binaries were
    built.  Thanks, Björn Torkelsson.  (Closes: #693311)
  * Remove the symlink from the openafs-fileserver doc directory to the
    openafs-client doc directory.  We used to install this symlink and
    share doc directories, but this stopped in 1.4.12+dfsg-1.  However,
    dpkg doesn't remove symlinks to a directory, so systems that had
    upgraded from the older package were overwriting openafs-client doc
    files with the openafs-fileserver versions.  Thanks, Andreas
    Beckmann.  (Closes: #694063)
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream tarball, Debian tarball, and
    binary packages.
  * Remove debian/import-upstream and change README.source to document
    using git-import-orig with --upstream-vcs-tag instead.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.
  * Update Vcs-* URLs for the new anonscm.debian.org URL layout.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4 (no changes required).

openafs (1.6.0~pre1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream prerelease.
    - Rx performance improvements.
    - Correct byte order handling of port in SRV record lookups.
    - More robust vos release to sites previously marked "don't use."
    - vos properly matches sites with multihomed servers.
    - Fix ptserver supergroups support on 64-bit platforms.
    - Bug fixes for demand-attach salvaging.
    - Avoid potential crash when attaching a volume fails.
    - Properly hold the host lock during host enumeration in fileserver.
    - Use larger I/O sizes in memcache to improve performance.
    - Avoid potential alignment issues in pioctl calls.
    - Servers now marked down when GetCapabilities returns an error.
    - Avoid blocking xvcache lock when freeing in-use vcaches.
    - In-use vcache count now properly tracked.
    - Properly configure LWP to use ucontext on appropriate platforms.
    - Eliminate spurious AFS system call errors.
    - Linux 2.6.37 support.
  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [4a3e5291] Update NEWS for 1.5.78 and 1.6.0pre1
  * In the openafs-client init script, don't attempt to stop or restart
    the AFS client if module loading is disabled.  Stopping afsd without
    unloading the module would leave the system in an inconsistent state.
  * Add $named to Should-Start in the openafs-client init script since the
    client may do DNS lookups for the VLDB and file servers during startup
    in some situations.  (Closes: #586226)
  * Drop --enable-reduced-depends for right now.  aklog doesn't deal with
    it correctly.
  * Now that upstream has renamed compile_et to afs_compile_et, include it
    in libopenafs-dev.
  * Update CellServDB to the 2010-12-13 version.

    - [f7f366d0] Link dafssync-debug(8) to fssync-debug(8)
    - [a2cf6b8d] Fix POD errors in fileserver and dasalvager
    - [e36b4e00] Update bos create man page for new demand-attach
  * Add backslashes to the DKMS command, which will be required once DKMS
    uses proper shell quoting.
  * In openafs-modules-source, use /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as the
    default path to the kernel headers rather than /usr/src/linux.
    Current kernel header packages will create an appropriate symlink
    there.  This default is only used when neither module-assistant nor
    kernel-package are used.
  * In the openafs-client init script, stop looking for openafs.o; Debian
    hasn't supported 2.4 kernels for quite some time.  Remove all the $MP
    handling since we force a module name of openafs.ko using
    --with-linux-kernel-packaging.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Sep 2010 21:37:03 -0700

openafs (1.5.77-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [7594331c] Add NEWS entries for OpenAFS 1.5.77 and 1.5.76
  * New upstream testing release.
    - Demand-attach servers are now always built and installed under
      separate names (dafileserver, davolserver, dasalvager).  This means
      that the default names are no longer demand-attach, which means that
      upgrades from previous experimental versions will fail (but upgrades
      from non-experimental versions will be much cleaner).
    - Linux 2.6.36 support and improved freezer interface support.
    - More robust path MTU detection.
    - Return VNOVOL from fileserver when a volume is deleted.
    - Improve handling of some corruption in the salvager.
    - Relax too-strict checks in ptserver on foreign names.
    - Better reporting of failures during volume attach.
    - Better fileserver handling of host hash collisions.
    - Fix statistics reporting in RXAFS_GetStatistics64.
    - Improved disconnected mode reference tracking.
    - Avoid a kernel panic during vcache contention.
    - Fix potential kernel panic during bulkstatus.
    - Better vos dry-run mode for syncvldb and syncserv.
    - Fix s390x kernel build support.
  * Update afs-newcell and README.servers to recommend using the
    demand-attach fileserver binaries and dafs bos type.
  * Force disabling of Linux syscall probing in kernel module builds.
  * Remove obsolete --enable-demand-attach-fs and --enable-disconnected
    configure flags.  These are now unconditional upstream.
  * The openafs-fileserver init script now depends on $named since
    apparently the volserver requires DNS during startup.  Thanks, Jaap
    Winius.  (Closes: #589783)
  * Use dpkg --print-architecture, not --print-installation-architecture,
    in the openafs-fileserver config script.  The latter is deprecated.
    Thanks, Peter Palfrader.  (Closes: #594488)
  * Add a dependency on libc6-dev to openafs-modules-dkms.  dkms doesn't
    depend on it because most kernel modules don't need it, but openafs
    builds userspace helper programs.  Thanks, Peter Palfrader.
  * Fix the sample CellServDB entry printed by afs-newcell if the cell
    isn't found in /etc/openafs/CellServDB to include the correct server
    syntax.  Thanks, Peter Palfrader.
  * Run the DKMS build commands in a subshell to work around a DKMS bug
    that caused the module build logs to be discarded.  (LP: #593509)
  * Add a status command to the openafs-fileserver init script.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Rewrite debian/rules to use dh and overrides.
    - Use dh_installdocs --link-doc to handle linked doc directories.
    - Rewrite debian/module/rules to use dh and overrides.
    - Bump -source package dependency and compat to debhelper 8.
  * Add ${perl:Depends} to openafs-modules-dkms and perl to the
    dependencies of openafs-modules-source, since Perl is used as part of
    the module build system now.
  * Remove bison and flex dependencies for the module build packages.  We
    now ship the results of rxgen, so don't need all the tools required to
    build the full source tree.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

    - [c3fc948e] Check for crypt in external library
    - [a1351d48] Fix ktime test on 64-bit systems
  * Use --after instead of --remaining in binary-indep to avoid running
    dh_auto_install and doing the installation process again.

openafs (1.5.75-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - Path MTU discovery for networks with bad fragmentation.
    - New -human flag for human-readable units in some fs commands.
    - Provide reasons for locked volumes in vos when known.
    - Improvements to Rx ping and NAT handling.
    - Improvements to the userspace AFS client.
    - Substantial updates to the Administrator's Guide.
    - Various bug fixes and improvements to the file server.
    - Force core file generation in bosserver.
    - Improve vlclient and vldb_check.
    - Avoid volume corruption on creation if files were left over from a
      previous failed cleanup.
    - Do not tie up fileserver threads with volumes being taken offline.
    - Break origin's callback on the target of a rename operation.
    - Do not open /dev/console in the fileserver.  (Closes: #582111)
    - Avoid unneeded sync() calls in the fileserver.
    - Update client disk cache version.
    - Parallelization improvements in lock management in the client.
    - New -dynroot-sparse mode for afsd to not show all cells in the
      CellServDB until that cell is needed.
    - Fix aklog crash with linked cell handling.
    - Fix fs getserverprefs -vlservers with default CellServDB list.
    - Report server address when logging warnings.
    - Avoid panic in GetCapabilities with an unknown cell.
    - Report process name and ID for advisory lock warnings when
      possible.
    - Flush pending changes to server when releasing file locks.
    - Various other client bug fixes on error handling and callbacks.
    - Disable syscall probes when keyrings are supported.
    - Use filehandles for all Linux 2.6 versions to avoid
      incompatibilities with mismatched afsds.
    - Update Linux kernel support for 2.6.35.
    - The stripped source tree generated for kernel module builds is now
      truly architecture-independent and can build on i386 for amd64
      kernels (for example).  (Closes: #518270)
    - Fix build problems on alpha.
  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [bbce0515] Add NEWS entries for 1.5.75
    - [c790e7d0] Remove a few erroneous NEWS entries for 1.5.75
    - [9e2aba99] Fix ktime test for errors
    - [5cc6293c] Provide man pages for more fssync-debug commands
  * Set the OpenAFS build version to the Debian package version with
    -debian appended so that the Debian package versions can be
    distinguished from unmodified upstream versions.
  * Build shared library packages for libafsauthent and libafsrpc.
    Upstream is now more careful about the ABI.  (Closes: #433054)
  * Explicitly link libafsauthent with -lresolv -lcrypt.  This is a
    temporary fix for Linux that will be replaced by a better upstream fix
    in the next release.
  * openafs-modules-source and openafs-modules-dkms are now architecture:
    all.  The generated kernel source is now architecture-independent.
  * openafs-modules-source and openafs-modules-dkms now recommend an
    appropriate version of openafs-client.
  * Update kernel module packaging scripts:
    - Remove selection of linux-image vs. kernel-image for kernel names.
    - Use Breaks instead of Conflicts.
    - Update standards version to 3.9.0.
  * Tighten the dependencies on openafs-client in packages that symlink
    their /usr/share/doc directories to openafs-client's to meet the
    Policy requirements for changelog files.
  * Remove the lpia architecture.  This was an experiment in Ubuntu that
    has apparently been dropped.
  * Add preliminary support for powerpcspe, mapping that architecture to
    ppc_linux26.  The kernel build won't work unless uname -m on that
    architecture returns ppc.
  * Minor update to README.Debian for openafs-doc: the old IBM release
    notes are no longer included.
  * Remove conflicts/replaces/provides for openafs-ptutil, which was
    ancient (removed in 2001).
  * Install an upstream changelog file now that upstream provides one.
  * Add a workaround in the clean target to allow the same packaging files
    to be used by upstream, which removes changelog during distclean
    because it's Autoconf-generated.  This workaround will not trigger
    during a normal Debian package build.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.0.
    - Use Breaks instead of Conflicts where appropriate.

openafs (1.5.74.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - Correctly recognize cache version differences in upgrades from 1.4
      and invalidate the old cache.
    - Resolve symlinks in fs rmmount.
    - Include PID in byte-range lock warning.
  * Preserve the AFS mount point and cache directories set in
    /etc/openafs/cacheinfo if the file already exists rather than
    overwriting them with the defaults.  Thanks, Liam Healy.
    (Closes: #580077)
  * In the openafs-client init script, don't assume that AFS is mounted on
    /afs when unmounting it or killing processes with AFS files open.
    Instead, parse /etc/mtab to find the AFS mount point.
  * Move the experimental afsd.fuse AFS FUSE client into openafs-fuse to
    avoid adding a FUSE dependency in openafs-client.  Document its
    current limitations in the package description.

    - [d80382ef] Remove special-case call for KAM_SetPassword on s390
  * Fix ucontext detection on ppc_linux26, hopefully fixing build failures
    on the Debian powerpc architecture.
  * Install afsd.fuse and a man page link for it if the FUSE client build
    is enabled.
  * Add build dependency on libfuse-dev and pass --enable-fuse-client to
    configure so that the new FUSE afsd is built.  Install afsd.fuse into
    the openafs-client package for the time being; it will move to some
    other package before being uploaded to unstable so that openafs-client
    doesn't keep a dependency on libfuse.  There is, as yet, no
    documentation or init script support for the FUSE implementation.

openafs (1.5.73.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream testing release.
    - New demand-attach file server support for greatly improved file
      server restart times.
    - Support for split readonly/read-write client caches.
    - Better client handling of file server meltdowns.
    - Experimental read-only client disconnected mode.
    - NFS translator clients now work properly on Linux.
    - Client cache readahead.
    - Network performance improvements.
    - New libkopenafs library providing a kernel PAG manipulation
      interface (a subset of the API provided by Heimdal's libkafs).
    - Fix builds on sparc64.  (LP: #181661)
  * Apply upstream deltas:
    - [7d395f17] Improve demand-attach fileserver bos documentation
    - [a763edc3] Make src/rx/rx.c not executable
    - [8d41bc24] Reallocate memory in aklog for the AFS ID string
    - [be449999] Fix typo in bos_create manpage
    - [fdb9429e] Linux: kmap() not page_address()
  * Build OpenAFS with demand-attach enabled for the file server, bos
    restricted mode enabled for bosserver, and disconnected mode enabled
    for the client.  Except for demand-attach, these options don't change
    the default behavior, just make new capabilities available.
  * The openafs-modules package now provides openafs-modules3 and
    conflicts on pre-1.5.61 openafs-client packages since the interface
    between afsd and the module has changed.  openafs-client now conflicts
    with openafs-modules2 and recommends openafs-modules3.
  * Change the default permissions of /etc/openafs/server to 0755 to match
    upstream defaults, but do not change permissions on upgrade.  The only
    file in that directory that needs to be protected is KeyFile, which
    should be mode 0600 anyway.  Drop the patch to bosserver to allow more
    restrictive permissions.  bosserver will complain about directory
    permissions after upgrade until the directory is manually changed.
  * Upstream now installs afszcm.cat and finds it in /usr/share/openafs/C,
    so use the version installed via make install and install it in the
    same location.
  * Upstream builds specific files with -fno-strict-aliasing where needed,
    so we no longer need to build the whole source with that flag.
  * Upstream no longer includes files covered by the Apple Public Source
    License, so we no longer have to repackage the upstream source to
    remove those files.  Drop Debian patches to the build system that were
    compensating for the removal of those files.
  * Switch to generating upstream tarballs from the upstream Git tag
    rather than from tarball releases.  There's no reason to include all
    the generated files when we're going to regenerate them anyway, and
    this saves effort combining the doc and src tarballs.

    - Build support for Linux 2.6.33.
    - Improvements to host tracking safety in the file server.
    - Fall back to current kernel credentials if we can't use stored ones.
    - Fix truncation handling in some large file situations.
    - Further fixes to mmap handling.
    - Avoid double-free in some FetchData64 error situations.
    - Stop warning about system call hooks when keyrings are in use.
    - Flush vcaches when a mount fails to avoid inconsistent data.
    - New dump tag and length standard for vos dump.
    - Fix stack executability for programs containing assembly code.
    - Various salvager robustness fixes.
  * Use dh_dkms from the DKMS package to handle creation of the maintainer
    scripts for openafs-modules-dkms rather than rolling our own.
    (LP: #497149)
  * Update init script to require $remote_fs be started first and stopped
    after OpenAFS.  This won't be the case in the long run, but for now
    some important boot-time options need /usr/bin/fs to set them.
  * List $syslog in Should-Start for the openafs-client init script, since
    otherwise if loading the module causes a kernel panic, it won't be
    logged to disk.
  * Update CellServDB to the 2010-02-28 version.
  * Add README.source explaining maintenance procedures and a
    debian/import-upstream script to do a Git-aware merge of a new
    upstream release that will allow us to cherry-pick upstream patches
    and do proper merges.
  * Stop linking the openafs-fileserver doc directory to openafs-client so

    postinst script (which we'll just use once it's reliably available).
    Thanks, Anders Kaseorg.  (LP: #487535)
  * Fix configure flags used for enabling or disabling LWP and kernel
    debugging flags and always pass --disable-strip-binaries.
  * Fix the openafs-dbg dependencies and package description to reflect
    its inclusion of debugging symbols for all server binaries in
    openafs-fileserver and openafs-dbserver, but not the legacy PAM
    modules.
  * In anticipation of a change in dpkg-source's defaults, force source
    package format 1.0.  The package is maintained using Git and
    generating a proper quilt series is complex and relatively pointless
    work, so the additional complexity of the 3.0 format is currently not

    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/fileserver-no-negative-fetchdata-20090926:
      never return a negative data length from client reads past the end
      of a file.
    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/fileserver-gethost-r-cleanup-fixes-20090925:

    - openafs-stable-1_4_x/kernel-init-vrequest-structure-20090914:
      properly initialize vrequest structure in the kernel.
  * Change the permissions of /var/lib/openafs/local to 0700 to match
    upstream defaults.  This directory contains the fssync.sock file used
    for coordination between the fileserver and the volserver, and
    commands sent to that socket are not authenticated.  Linux protects
    the socket from unprivileged writes by default, but other operating
    systems do not.  Upstream therefore wants this directory to be 0700
    and bosserver will complain by default if it's not.  Changing the
    permissions let us drop a patch to bosserver.
  * Fix the second module control file for the standards version, section,
    and maintainer update.
  * Change the source package name of the stripped package generated by
    openafs-modules-source so that, should someone build a Debian source
    package from it, it won't have the same name as the main openafs
    source package.

  * Add armv5tel to debian/sysname, mapping it to arm_linux26.  Patch from
    Daniel Bayer.  Also make the similar change for the module source
    package.  (Closes: #542315)
  * Also install restorevol in the openafs-client package.
  * Swap maintainer and uploaders in the packaging files for the module
    source package, matching the main package.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.3.
    - Change section of packages generated by openafs-modules-source to
      kernel.
    - Add Homepage to packages generated by openafs-modules-source.

openafs (1.4.11~pre3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
    - Further fixes for rcu_read_lock dependencies in some kernels.
    - Clean up return values of Linux vnode operations.
    - Call inode's setattr operation correctly.
  * Ignore failures to remove an existing DKMS tree in the prerm of the
    openafs-modules-dkms package.  In the possible cases where the tree
    may not be present to be removed, failing package removal doesn't
    make sense.  (Further addresses LP #368471.)
  * Don't install man pages for fs command variants that are only
    available on Windows.
  * Bring src/config/linux-version closer to upstream since upstream now
    handles unversioned source directories.  There is one remaining change
    required to search for UTS_RELEASE in the correct header path.
  * Update CellServDB to 2009-06-29 version.
  * Translation updates:

  * Apply upstream CVS deltas:
    - STABLE14-dprintf-rename-20090427: rename AFS's dprintf to avoid
      conflicts with one in the kernel.
    - STABLE14-linux26-defer-cred-changing-20090511: defer changing groups
      when the real and effective credentials of a process differ to avoid
      running afoul of checks in newer Linux kernels that cause oops.
      (Closes: #528785)
    - STABLE14-linux-mmap-antirecursion-fix-20090512 and
      STABLE14-linux-mmap-antirecursion-avoid-spurious-eio-20090526:
      improvements in flag setting and locking around recursive mmap
      protection.
    - STABLE14-memcache-write-on-laststore-20090512: write back dirty
      pages on last store with memcache to avoid losing changes.
    - STABLE14-background-fsync-consistency-issues-20090522: file
      descriptor handling fixes for the file server.

      -omitdirs flags to vos dump.  (Closes: #502571)
  * Provide an openafs-modules-dkms package that uses DKMS to dynamically
    build kernel modules for the local kernel and document this option in
    README.modules.  This is an alternative to installing
    openafs-modules-source and building kernel modules for each new kernel
    with module-assistant or make-kpkg.  (Closes: #168852, #525131)
    (LP: #52786, #368471, #369875)
  * Have openafs-client recommend at least the current source version of
    openafs-modules-source or openafs-modules-dkms instead of any old
    version.  While the API probably hasn't changed, it's best practice to
    keep a relatively close match between the userspace andn the kernel
    module version.  (LP: #369875)
  * Dynamically determine the Debian and upstream versions for dkms.conf
    and get-orig-source from debian/changelog.  Thanks, Anders Kaseorg.

openafs (1.4.10+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - OPENAFS-SA-2009-001: Avoid a potential kernel memory overrun if more
      items than requested are returned from an InlineBulk or BulkStatus
      message.  (CVE-2009-1251)
    - OPENAFS-SA-2009-002: Avoid converting negative errors into invalid
      kernel memory pointers.  (CVE-2009-1250)
    - Preliminary support for 2.6.30 kernels.
    - Dynamic vcache allocation support to deal with inotify vcache
      pinning.
    - Do appropriate locking for CellServDB in /proc.
    - Use +dfsg instead of .dfsg for saner version sorting.
  * Debian's 2.6.29 packages no longer include symlinks from the
    architecture-specific header tree to the common header tree and
    instead overlay both header trees using kbuild.  Change the Autoconf
    probes to always use kbuild and generate stub headers in the paths
    that OpenAFS expects that include the linux headers.  Patch from Aaron
    M. Ucko.  (Closes: #521745)
  * Build PIC versions of libafsauthent and libafsrpc and install them in
    libopenafs-dev for use when AFS code should be embedded into shared
    libraries.  Patch from Garrett Wollman.
  * Update CellServDB to 2008-11-07 version.  (Closes: #522451)
  * Update debian/watch for +dfsg naming instead of .dfsg.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes required).

openafs (1.4.8.dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make openafs-modules-source architecture-specific (arch: any instead
    of arch: all).  The new method for generating the kernel source tree
    only generates correct build machinery for the architecture on which
    it was built, making the package architecture-specific.  The generated
    tree is so much smaller that this still only uses about 1MB of archive
    space more than the old method and makes each openafs-modules-source
    package much smaller.  This is a workaround until we can fix
    libafs_tree to include enough build machinery to handle all Linux
    architectures from one source tree.  (Closes: #516023)
  * Explicitly remove *-stamp files in the clean target of the module
    build until the module build is upgraded to debhelper 7.

openafs (1.4.8.dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: #511535)
    - Support 2.6.28 kernels.  (LP: #303112)
    - Check at compile time that the kernel has keyring support rather
      than building non-functional modules.  (Closes: #500850)
    - Include vos clone man page.  (LP: #324449)
  * Apply upstream CVS deltas:
    - STABLE14-libuafs-updates-20081229: prerequisite for other deltas.
    - STABLE14-linux-truncate-race-20090109: avoid race condition during
      truncation.
    - STABLE14-linux-i-size-20090112: further fix for truncation race.
    - STABLE14-linux-truncate-cleanup-20090113: further truncation fix.

      (Closes: #513680)
    - STABLE14-rx-idledead-only-ignore-keepalives-20081222: rx bug fix to
      not ignore other ping packets.
    - STABLE14-rx-rdwr-writeproc-race-20081228: fix rx race condition that
      could result in reuse of freed memory.
    - STABLE14-rx-do-not-race-current-packet-20090105: fix rx race
      condition.
  * Use make libafs_tree to generate the tree for the kernel module
    compile rather than copying the entire source tree.
  * Compress the source in openafs-modules-source with bzip2 instead of
    gzip to reduce the package size.
  * Make dynroot the default for new installations.  It works much better
    with systems that don't bring up their network until late in the boot
    process, such as wireless laptops.  (LP: #249240, #318605)
  * Mention libpam-afs-session instead of libpam-openafs-session in the
    description of libpam-openafs-kaserver, and mention libpam-krb5 by
    name.  Thanks, Philipp Kaluza.  (Closes: #501308)
  * Suggest module-assistant auto-install in README.modules and be clearer
    that building one's own kernel is not required.  Thanks, Anders
    Kaseorg and Lutz Goehring for suggestions.  (LP: #295897)
  * Allow time-daemon to satisfy the openafs-fileserver recommends in
    addition to ntp, allowing for openntpd.  (Closes: #508258)
  * General improvements to debconf configuration handling.
    - Do not abort the config script if we have no default realm and
      dnsdomainname fails.  (LP: #274886, #318132)
    - Do not abort postinst if we can't resolve any host name for the
      cell.  Just continue in that case, omitting any configuration for
      the local cell.  (LP: #322054)
    - Correctly set the default for AFS_CRYPT from the existing config.
    - The cache size is high, not critical, since we have a default.
    - Don't create the client ThisCell if no local cell was specified.
    - Improve the leading comment in afs.conf.client.  Users can edit it,
      but any changes other than the setting values will be lost.
    - Remove the openafs-fileserver/bosconfig_moved template, which would
      only be shown on upgrades from pre-1.2.0 versions.
    - Standardize coding style and always quote strings.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V7.
    - Use dh where possible in debian/rules.
    - Use dh_lintian to install Lintian overrides.
    - Eliminate the configure target and do all the work in build.
    - Do more in the install target and less in binary, matching the
      default command stacks in dh.
    - Use a debian/clean configuration file to let dh clean do more of the
      work rather than using rm commands in debian/rules.
  * Abort the config script rather than exiting successfully if the
    debconf shell module is not available.  The config script should never
    be run in the absence of debconf, so if this fails, something deeper
    is wrong and we shouldn't blindly continue.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all dependencies.
  * Add explanations for the Lintian overrides.
  * Use set -e instead of #!/bin/sh -e in maintainer scripts.
  * Remove server documentation from openafs-modules-source.

    Thanks, Marc Dionne.  (Closes: #493914)
  * Apply upstream deltas to support 2.6.27 kernels and to stop using
    COMMON_KERN_CFLAGS for all 2.6 kernels uniformly, which fixes
    problems on amd64 with newer kernels.  Thanks, Björn Torkelsson.

openafs (1.4.7.dfsg1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop support for hppa.  We only have a param file for a 2.4 kernel,
    we were building with UCONTEXT which is stubbed out in glibc for hppa,
    and builds without UCONTEXT fail.  The binaries we were building
    before didn't work and no one reported a bug, indicating no one was
    attempting to use OpenAFS on hppa.
  * When building the kernel module, use the setting of the ARCH
    environment or make variable, if present, in preference to uname -m to
    allow cross-compiles.  Thanks, Jose Calhariz.  (Closes: #492232)

    Thanks, Dominic Hargreaves.  (Closes: #490752)
  * Don't use UCONTEXT on hppa; its glibc doesn't provide those
    functions.  It's possible that OpenAFS isn't working properly on hppa
    these days, but as yet there have been no reports.
  * Suggest openafs-krb5 in openafs-client and mention it in the long

openafs (1.4.7.dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream delta for Linux 2.6.26 support.
  * Enable support for arm and armel, added upstream in 1.4.7.
  * Enable support for lpia by making it synonymous with i386.  This means
    that lpia systems will get a sysname of i386_linux26, which isn't
    ideal but should at least work.
  * When clearing the restart time while installing a new cell, pass
    -localauth to avoid an authentication failure.  Thanks, Davor Ocelic.
    (Closes: #488152)
  * If the openafs module isn't listed in modules.dep, exit with a zero
    status from the init script even if modprobe fails.  Otherwise, if a
    module package and openafs-client are installed at the same time and
    openafs-client is set up before the module package, the init script
    can find the module, fail the modprobe (because the dependency map
    hasn't yet been updated), and fail the whole installation.  Exiting
    with a zero status still doesn't get OpenAFS started, but at least it
    doesn't leave the system in a partly installed state.  Thanks to Durk
    Strooisma for the analysis.  (Closes: #486816)
  * Don't include debug symbols for /sbin, /usr/bin, and /usr/sbin
    binaries or PAM modules in openafs-dbg, just the servers in
    /usr/lib/openafs, since those are the most likely cases where
    backtraces are important and a 10MB debug symbol package seems like
    overkill.
  * Stop using quilt to manage patches and pre-apply them to the source
    package now that the package is maintained with Git.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Reflect current responsibilities more accurately by listing myself as
    maintainer and Sam as uploader.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).
  * Drop unused postinst-uses-db-input override; Lintian has been fixed.
  * Translation updates:

    - Better fileserver host tracking.
    - Ubik fixes preventing database truncation on unreliable links.
  * Add upstream delta to fix oops on startup with pre-2.6.25 kernels.
  * Install the up man page as afs-up, matching our renaming, and update

  * Move openafs-client later in the shutdown sequence on new

    - Prevent one client from consuming all file server threads.
  * Remove the workaround added for 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 kernels with
    CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled.  The mistaken GPL-labelling of core
    interfaces was fixed in 2.6.22, which has now migrated to testing.
  * Scan /var/log/openafs for core files with a PID appended when a server
    run by bosserver exits with a signal.  bosserver was unable to
    correctly handle core files for multithreaded servers since it
    expected a filename of core and Linux always appends a PID to core
    dumps by multithreaded processes.
  * Fix make kdist in openafs-modules-source, inadvertently broken by a
    missing genchanges script.
  * Stop creating /var/lib/openafs/cores.  Nothing actually uses it.

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to quilt for managing patches to the upstream source.
  * Stop installing the Administrator's Reference.  All of the useful
    information in here has been converted to man pages.
  * Use the upstream man page for pt_util, which lets us remove the
    docbook-to-man build dependency.
  * Update to the latest CellServDB from grand.central.org.
  * Trim additional unuseful debug information from openafs-dbg.
  * Restructure the source for the module package.  The build files for
    the module build are now in debian/module in the source package and
    there is a completely separate rules file.  This way, the module build
    rules don't have to depend on quilt and the structure is clearer.
  * Fix debhelper dependencies for the module build.
  * Update module standards version to 3.7.2 (no changes required).

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch for the OpenAFS file server to treat clients that
    have an all-zero UUID as if they don't have UUID support, working
    around bugs in various client versions that can cause multiple hosts
    to use all-zero UUIDs and conflict with each other.
  * Use dpkg --print-architecture to determine the AFS sysname for both
    regular builds (avoiding --print-installation-architecture, which is
    deprecated) and kernel builds (avoiding arch, which is temporarily not
    in unstable and which wouldn't do the right thing for cross-compiles).
    Thanks, Chris Hanson.  (Closes: #435765)
  * Add hppa as a recognized architecture for kernel module builds,
    although OpenAFS currently only supports 2.4 kernels on HPPA so this
    isn't that useful.

  * Apply upstream patch from Jeffrey Hutzelman to fix syscall probing on
    AMD64 with Linux 2.6.22 kernels.  (Closes: #430179)
  * Add a union to des_ks_struct and reorder includes to get the correct
    alignment for DES code on SPARC.  Thanks, Chaskiel Grundman.  Partly
    addresses #415952.
  * Fix a typo in debian/kern-sysname that caused openafs-modules-source
    to still assume all ia64 systems used Linux 2.4.  Thanks, Jakob
    Haufe.  (Closes: #432344)
  * Use LSB logging functions for openafs-fileserver and support passing
    arguments to bosserver in /etc/default/openafs-fileserver by setting
    DAEMON_ARGS.
  * Clean up more completely after a purge of openafs-fileserver.  Remove
    the files created by the server in /var/lib/openafs/local, remove
    KeyFile and CellServDB.old from /etc/openafs/server, and remove
    BosConfig from /etc/openafs.

    builds on ppc64.  (Closes: #427555)
  * Apply upstream patches for Linux 2.6.22 support.  (Closes: #428401)
  * Apply upstream patch to fix the AFS /proc structure under Linux
    2.6.22.1 and later.
  * Move /etc/openafs/server-local to /var/lib/openafs/local.  Most of the
    files here are automatically generated and hence not configuration
    files, and the file server has to write to this directory to start (so
    having it in /etc breaks read-only / file systems).  Thanks, Alexei
    Sheplyakov.  (Closes: #405697)
  * Move upserver and upclient to /usr/lib/openafs (from /usr/sbin) to
    match upstream's layout and for consistency with the other servers run
    via bosserver.
  * Use --name instead of --exec in the openafs-fileserver init script and
    drop the --pidfile option (bosserver doesn't create a PID file) so
    that we don't start a second bosserver on upgrades.
  * Go back to using krb5-config.  The dependency problem has now been
    fixed on all platforms in the krb5 package and this is the preferred
    upstream method.

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always generate a UUID on client startup even if for some reason we
    don't think we have any network interfaces.  Otherwise, the client
    will use an all-zeroes UUID, which will collide with every other
    client with the same problem.
  * When afsd is started with -rmtsys, it starts another process that afsd
    -shutdown doesn't kill.  Update the init script to kill this process
    on stop.  (Closes: #405982)
  * Don't use krb5-config to get a library list.  It runs the risk of
    encoding unnecessary library dependencies.  Instead, hard-code the
    flags and libraries we actually need.  (Closes: #424448)
  * When loading a module using the upstream naming convention, don't
    append the .mp to the module name for modprobe.  (Closes: #420597)

openafs (1.4.4.dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian kernels as of 2.6.20 enable CONFIG_PARAVIRT, which redefines
    several core kernel calls as redirects through a paravirt.ops table
    that's marked GPL-only.  This breaks all non-GPL modules that used
    those (previously generally exported) calls even indirectly.  Apply a
    hack to switch from spin_lock_irq to spin_lock_irqsave to avoid the
    paravirt redirection so that the module will build.
  * Enable ucontext for all Linux builds with glibc 2.4 or later, not just
    with i386 and amd64, and (following an upstream patch) always use
    ucontext on ia64.  Newer versions of glibc change internal structures
    in ways that cause the old LWP code to have stack overflows.
    (Closes: #419903) 
  * Apply upstream patch to crashes on contention in afs_xuser when a
    process in a PAG exits.  Thanks, Chaskiel Grundman.
  * When determining the AFS sysname for kernel module builds, add
    explicit cases for 2.6 kernels for all architectures that support them
    (everything except non-64-bit sparc_linux).  Fixes build problems with
    ia64 and probably other architectures.  Thanks to Ippokratis Pandis
    for the debugging help.  (Closes: #411818)
  * Prefer alpha_linux_26 to alpha_linux_24 for the non-kernel build on
    Alpha, now that the source supports it.
  * Add support for the s390x architecture.  Upstream supports it and
    there's no reason not to.
  * Fix the watch file to remove .dfsg\d+ when comparing versions.

  * Apply patch from Thomas Sesselmann to support setting options to pass
    to bosserver in /etc/default/openafs-fileserver.  (Closes: #409357)
  * Remove the rx_Init calls in the PAM module.  The internal counters
    that had to be initialized that way have been removed.
  * Now that we're running regen.sh as part of the build process, only
    patch the Autoconf source files and not the generated output to make
    the diff easier to audit.

openafs (1.4.2-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY: Apply upstream patch to disable setuid status on all cells
    by default.  Prior versions of AFS defaulted to honoring setuid bits
    in the local cell, but since unauthenticated file access in AFS is
    unencrypted, an attacker could forge packets from an AFS file server
    to synthesize a setuid binary in AFS.
  * Apply upstream fix to use a single high-numbered group for the PAG on
    2.6 kernels and sort the group properly.  Fixes AFS-caused group
    ordering problems that could lead the kernel to ignore some group
    membership for users.  (Closes: #414911)
  * Apply upstream fix for segfaults in pts rename.  (Closes: #409184)
  * Apply upstream fix to show reasonable free space numbers for AFS in
    df.  Without this fix, some programs which use df to check free space
    may think that directories in AFS are full and prevent the user from
    attempting to write files.  (Closes: #415294)

  * Apply patch to allow the module to build with the Ubuntu kernel.
    Thanks, Björn Torkelsson.  (Closes: #342607)

  * Backport man pages from upstream CVS.  (Closes: #79763)
  * Include afsmonitor and livesys in openafs-client.
  * Include volinfo in openafs-fileserver.
  * Document FAM's lack of support for AFS's security model and recommend
    gamin instead.  (Closes: #343246)
  * Add a hint to README.Debian on what to do about the cache partition if
    running ReiserFS or XFS without a spare partition.
  * Use make install into debian/tmp rather than make dest.  make dest is
    mostly for Transarc compatibility and make install looks more like a
    typical package and makes it easier to evaluate differences in FHS
    location between upstream and Debian.  As a side effect, there's no
    need to mess with the @sys link.  (Closes: #165909)

  * Do not install kpwvalid.  The default version does little useful and
    the kpwvalid binary must be in AFS for it to take effect.
  * Overhaul the way kernel modules are built.
    - Recommend linux-image rather than kernel-image for newer kernels.
    - Always recommend the kernel package; since it's only a recommends,
      there's no need to special-case the hand-built kernel case.
    - Be less fragile about how the kernel version is used in prep-modules
      to support other ways kernel modules are built.  (Closes: #341836)
    - Add Build-Depends and Uploaders to the openafs-modules-source
      control file.
    - Remove unused parts of prep-modules and heavily comment it.
  * openafs-client should only recommend the AFS kernel module.  Many of
    the client programs will work in unauthenticated mode without it, and
    openafs-fileserver depends on it (but doesn't require the kernel
    module).  (Closes: #342095)

  * Remove the init script check of the cache file system and instead
    improve the check in afsd.  The init script check used stat, which is
    in /usr/bin and therefore not fair game for init scripts.
  * Set PATH in the init script, just in case.
  * libpam-openafs-kaserver must depend on openafs-client, not just
    recommend it, since acquiring tokens requires that the client be

openafs (1.3.87-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Fixes build problems with 2.6.12.3 and later.  (Closes: #320099)
  * Add support for ppc64, thanks Andreas Jochens.  (Closes: #322020)
  * Improve the openafs-client init script.
    - Update the default client options based on the cache tuning synopsis
      by Jeffrey Hutzelman, including setting a larger chunksize for all
      default option sets.  (Closes: #303944)
    - Choose the client options based on the cache size by default.
    - Move the code to build the options string to the init script from
      afs.conf so that afs.conf is pure configuration.
    - Add an AFS_PRE_SHUTDOWN hook called before shutting down the client.
    - Provide a shutdown hook, disabled by default, that kills all
      processes with files open in /afs.  Enabling this ensures a more
      reliable clean shutdown and umounting of the cache partition, but
      may not always be what the admin wants.
    - Improve the readability of the output on start.
    - Significantly improve the comments in afs.conf.
    - Remove the code to set -nosettime as it's now the default.
  * Move the openafs-client init script and afs.conf file we use into the
    debian directory rather than patching the upstream version.  We've
    diverged so much that there's no point in continuing to merge changes.
  * Diagnose unsupported architectures earlier and with a clearer error.
  * Suppress error messages from a missing kernel version header since
    they occur normally when doing the regular package build and are just
    confusing.  Instead, print an error in kern-sysname and abort if the
    kernel version could not be determined.
  * Rework how PAM modules are handled.
    - Build against the pthread-aware libraries.  (Closes: #297804)
    - Use the shared library objects instead of building separate PIC
      objects, eliminating the need for many Makefile modifications.
    - Include pam_afs.krb.so as well.  (Closes: #165972)
  * Don't include the empty /usr/src/modules directory in
    openafs-modules-source, only the tarball, to match how other kernel
    module source packages behave.  (Closes: #244685)
  * Update config.guess and config.sub.
  * Translation updates.
    - French, thanks Christian Perrier.  (Closes: #318807)
    - Vietnamese, thanks Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #319705)
    - Czech, thanks Martin Sin.  (Closes: #319940)

openafs (1.3.82-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Output error messages from heredocs in the init script with cat rather
    than echo.  Thanks, Reid Barton.  (Closes: #311729)
  * Make bosserver less picky about permissions and remove the attempt to
    set /etc/openafs/server-local not-world-readable since dh_fixperms was
    overridding it anyway.  (Closes: #312921)
  * Fix some spacing and capitalization errors in the debconf templates.
    Thanks, Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #316597)
  * Initial Czech translation, thanks Martin Sin.  (Closes: #310699)
  * New Vietnamese translation, thanks Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #316598)
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Mon, 11 Jul 2005 17:34:13 -0700

openafs (1.3.82-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  (Closes: #307699)
    - Proper locking for preempt kernels.  This bug manifested as an
      inability to shut down AFS cleanly.  (Closes: #308399, #304040)
    - Correctly handle the inotify semaphore.  (Closes: #303495)
  * Repackage upstream to remove MacOS-specific files covered by the APSL.
    Remove the WINNT directory to save space since we have to repackage
    anyway.  Provide a get-orig-source target to do the repackaging.
  * libpam-openafs-kaserver: Fix compilation so that the PAM module isn't
    missing symbols and therefore unusable.  (Closes: #308844)
  * Apply patch from Chas Williams to fix stale cache data from deleted
    files, a bug introduced in 1.3.82.
  * In all cases, only build the module appropriate to the kernel we're
    building against.  Building an SMP module against a non-SMP kernel
    fails due to missing defines.  (Closes: #225907)
  * README.modules: Add documentation for module-assistant and recommend
    it when using Debian kernels.  Mention divergences from upstream in
    module naming.  (Closes: #253168)  Emphasize that the kernel source
    tree used for make-kpkg must be identically configured to the kernel
    the module will be used with.
  * Update copyright with more complete information from upstream
    src/LICENSE.
  * Simplify clean target.  Upstream make distclean is now better.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Tue, 10 May 2005 21:09:55 -0700

openafs (1.3.81-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle modules named either with or without the .mp extension on SMP
    hosts.  (Closes: #305389, #307280, #307797)
  * README.Debian: Document that the client cache partition must be ext2
    or ext3 and that XFS and ReiserFS will not work.  upserver and
    upclient are now provided.  Provide some information about why
    kaserver is not provided.  (Closes: #249315)
  * Overhaul the module build rules.
    - Use debhelper to build the module binary package.
    - Let debhelper handle the module postinst and prerm control scripts.
    - Properly support modules_config and modules_clean.
    - Break the build process into configure, build, install, and binary
      rules, paralleling the regular build rules and making it easier to
      maintain the make-kpkg build targets.
    - Include the kernel version in the long description.
    - Update standards version of module packages to 3.6.1.
    - Include the copyright and basic documentation in the module binary
      package.  Otherwise, policy requires an exact versioned dependency
      on the package containing the copyright file.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
    - Install Debian::OpenAFS::ConfigUtils in /usr/share, not /usr/lib.
    - Always enable debugging symbols and disable optimization if noopt is
      set in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  (Alas, this doesn't entirely work; the
      upstream makefiles don't always honor the configure options.)
    - /etc/init.d/openafs-fileserver restart starts bosserver if it's not
      already running.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V4.
    - Remove all *.conffiles control files.  They're no longer needed.
    - Use misc:Depends to get debconf dependencies.
    - Use dh_install rather than the movefiles script.
  * openafs-dbserver doesn't need to depend on debconf.
  * Use dh_perl to get the correct Perl dependency for openafs-dbserver.
  * Remove unnecessary build dependencies.
  * Depend on comerr-dev rather than e2fslibs-dev.
  * Remove unnecessary preinst for openafs-fileserver.
  * Clean up and reformat package build rules.
  * Update lintian overrides.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Sat,  7 May 2005 20:57:12 -0700

openafs (1.3.81-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * make-kpkg doesn't run fakeroot for us but instead expects the module
    rules file to use $(ROOT_CMD) appropriately.  (Closes: #237861)
  * Put the compiled modules into KPKG_DEST_DIR if set.  This appears to
    be preferred over DEB_DEST by the make-kpkg documentation.  Thanks,
    Jonas Smedegaard.  (Closes: #206403)
  * Add a check to afs-newcell to ensure the local hostname doesn't
    resolve to 127.0.0.1.  (Closes: #163751)
  * Exclude .svn directories from the modules source tarball.
  * Fix genchanges for module builds to not fail when trying to remove a
    nonexistent file.
    * New French translations from Christian Perrier, Closes: #305780

  upstream made a forward and backward incompatible change in the modules
  interface.

  * Fix PPC makefile so that it finds install; this time actually
    submitted upstream.

  * Swallow before vomiting, for it is the Debconf way, closes: #106030
  * Fix setting of INSTALL macro on powerpc, closes: #106019

    about in DNS.

    looping rxdebug and version amongst each other.
  * Install rxdebug (oops)
  * Fix lintian overrides to get Lintian to stop complaining about

  *  New upstream snapshot
  * Fix module package to not have build cruft
  * Use --disable-kernel-module option except for module sources
  * Attempt to build modules correctly, although still not in right place
  * Pretend we build for alpha. This is mostly not a fiction, although I
    don't really know that much more than the kernel module and afsd
    work.  The pointer cast warnings are frightening.

  * New upstream version, closes: #92776
  * Allow openafs-client to depend on openafs-modules-source not just
    openafs-modules.  This allows us to be installable on testing even
    without binary modules which may become a necessity given the current
    kernel image mess.

openafs (1.0.snap20001106-8) unstable; urgency=low

    This works better for AFS, even though it is not the way packages like
    alsa-base work.

  * Increase stacksize for server processes so they don't dump core.
  * New script: afs-rootvol--creates the root.afs and root.cell.  Works
    fairly well except that it is overly verbose and that it has my test

    config tool.
