/* The structure of the data portion of an acknowledge packet: An acknowledge
 * packet is in network byte order at all times.  An acknowledgement is always
 * prompted for a specific reason by a specific incoming packet.  This reason
 * is reported in "reason" and the packet's sequence number in the packet
 * header.seq.  In addition to this information, all of the current
 * acknowledgement information about this call is placed in the packet.
 * "FirstPacket" is the sequence number of the first packet represented in an
 * array of bytes, "acks", containing acknowledgement information for a number
 * of consecutive packets.  All packets prior to FirstPacket are implicitly
 * acknowledged: the sender need no longer be concerned about them.  Packets
 * from firstPacket+nAcks and on are not acknowledged.  Packets in the range
 * [firstPacket,firstPacket+nAcks) are each acknowledged explicitly.  The
 * acknowledgement may be RX_NACK if the packet is not (currently) at the
 * receiver (it may have never been received, or received and then later
 * dropped), or it may be RX_ACK if the packet is queued up waiting to be read
 * by the upper level software.  RX_ACK does not imply that the packet may not
 * be dropped before it is read; it does imply that the sender should stop
 * retransmitting the packet until notified otherwise.  The field
 * previousPacket identifies the previous packet received by the peer.  This
 * was used in a previous version of this software, and could be used in the
 * future.  The serial number in the data part of the ack packet corresponds to
 * the serial number oof the packet which prompted the acknowledge.  Any
 * packets which are explicitly not acknowledged, and which were last
 * transmitted with a serial number less than the provided serial number,
 * should be retransmitted immediately.  Actually, this is slightly inaccurate:
 * packets are not necessarily received in order.  When packets are habitually
 * transmitted out of order, this is allowed for in the retransmission
 * algorithm by introducing the notion of maximum packet skew: the degree of
 * out-of-orderness of the packets received on the wire.  This number is
 * communicated from the receiver to the sender in ack packets. */
